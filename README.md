### 🌌 Why **PetitPrince**?  
It all started with the famous **Petit Prince** by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, a book that marked my childhood.  
This nickname followed me in my early online adventures (games and websites).  

But why **PetitPrinceQLF** here?  
Well... **PetitPrince** was already taken 😅, so I added a nod to the rap group PNL with **QLF** *(Que La Famille)*.
